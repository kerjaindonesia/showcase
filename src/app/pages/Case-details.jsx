                    As a result, most of us need to know how to use computers. Our
                    knowledge of computers will help us to tap into challenging career
                    opportunities and enhance the quality of our lives. It is imperative
                    that quality students be encouraged and motivated to study computers
                    and become capable and responsible IT professionals. The education
                    model needs to align itself with dynamically changing technology to
                    meet the growing need for skilled IT manpower and deliver
                    state-of-the-art, industry relevant and technology ready programs.​
                    Today, the term Information Technology (IT) has ballooned to
                    encompass many aspects of computing and technology and the term is
                    more recognizable than ever before. The Information Technology
                    umbrella can be quite large, covering many fields. IT professionals
                    perform a variety of duties that range from installing applications,
                    managing information, to designing complex applications, managing
                    computer networks and designing and managing databases.
